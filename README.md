[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not
yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the
public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

Like [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com) but for researchers' data.

This project was started at a Hackday in the [Software Sustainability
Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)'s [Collaborations Workshop
2025](https://www.software.ac.uk/publication/cw25-programme).
